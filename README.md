Buisness Logic

1. Determine user's age based on planet's solar years

  -Create a galactic object housing all planets with corresponding earth years
  Earth: 365 days
  Mercury: 0.24 Earth Years
  Venus: 0.62 Earch Years
  Mars: 1.88 Earth Years
  Jupiter: 11.86 Earth Years
  -Compute age based on planet selected -> via method on that object?


2. Determine how many years a user has left to live on each planet

  -Collect info from user into a User Object:
  Lifestyle
  Country of Residence
  Activity Level
  Smoker Status
  -Determine life expectancy based on User Object 
    -Assign an increase/decrease in number of years to base year based on inputs
  -Convert life expectancy into solar years based on planet
    -use method to convert age here
  -Subtract current age from life expectacy based on planet
    -create a method to use with User Object

3. If user has lived past life expectancy return number of years past life expectancy
  
  -Create conditional statement checking to see if life expectancy is a negative number
